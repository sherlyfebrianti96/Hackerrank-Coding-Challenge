### Tree

The **Table of Content** was generated using `Tree`.

Run this script to generate a `TreeView` of the Table of Content :

```
sh ./table-of-content.sh
```

By default, Windows and Linux already have the `Tree` command.

If you are using Mac, you could install `Tree` using this command :

```
brew install tree
```
